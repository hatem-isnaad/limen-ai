## Overall Status

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| Repository | Created |
| Architecture docs | Complete |
| Contracts | Complete |
| Config repositories | Complete |
| DTOs / value objects | Complete |
| LLM providers | Fake + OpenAI skeleton |
| Embedding providers | Fake driver |
| Runtime | Not started |
| Tool pipeline | Not started |
| UI | Not started |

## Current Phase

**Phase 03 — Provider System** (Complete)

## Completed

- Phase 01 architecture foundation
- Config-backed DTOs: Agent, Tool, Skill, Workflow
- Config repositories with service provider bindings
- `RunContextData` value object
- Example skill + knowledge collection in config
- Unit and integration tests for repositories
- `FakeLlmProvider` and `FakeEmbeddingProvider`
- `LlmProviderManager` and `EmbeddingProviderManager`
- `OpenAiProvider` skeleton with HTTP mapping
- Provider unit/integration/architecture tests

## In Progress

- Phase 04 — Agent System enhancements

## Blocked

- None

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 04 — Agent resolution helpers
2. Begin Phase 05 — Tool execution pipeline
3. Begin Phase 06 — Core runtime loop

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Scope explosion | Strict phase gates + architecture tests |
| LLM bypass of auth | Tool pipeline enforces Laravel authorization |
| Tight coupling to Limen | Architecture rules + forbidden dependency tests |
| SaaS rewrite later | Repository abstractions from day one |
